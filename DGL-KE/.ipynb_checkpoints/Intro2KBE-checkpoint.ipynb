    "Knowledge graphs that are beyond toy examples are always large, high dimensional, and sparse. High dimensionality and sparsity are the results of the amount of information that the KG holds that can be represented with 1-hot or n-hot vectors. The fact that most of the items have no relationship withe one another is another major contributor to sparsity of KG representations. We, therefore desire to project the sparse and high dimensional graph representational vector space onto a lower dimensional dense space. This process is similar to to word embedding and dimensionality reduction used for [recommender systems baesd on matrix factorization models.](https://www.slideshare.net/apachemxnet/building-content-recommendation-systems-using-mxnet-gluon)\n",

A fact in the source space is represented as a triplet $(h, r, t)$ where $h$ is short for *head*, $r$ is for *relation*, and $t$ is for *tail*. The relationship is interpreted as a translation vector so that the embedded entities are connected by relation $r$ have a short distance. [3, 4]\n",
    "In terms of vector computation it could mean adding a head to a relation should approximate to the relation's tail, or $h+r \\approx t$.

TransR addresses this issue with separating relationship space from entity space where $h, t \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ and $r \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. The semantic spaces do not need to be of the same dimension. In the multi-relationship modeling we learn a projection matrix $M\\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times d}$ for each relationship that can project an entity to different relationship semantic spaces. Each of these spaces capture a different aspect of an entity that is related to a distinct relationship. In this case a head node $h$ and a tail node $t$ in relation to relationship $r$ is projected into the relationship space using the learned projection matrix $M_r$ as $h_r=hM_r$ and $t_r=tM_r$ respectively.Figure 5 illustrates this projection.\n",

    "Let us explore this using an example. Mary and Tom are siblings and colleagues. They both are vegetarians. Joe also works for Amazon and is a colleague of Mary and Tom. TransE might end up learning very similar embedding for Mary, Tom, and Joe from the fact that they are colleagues but fail to recognize the (not)sibling relationship.\n",

    "#### Drawbacks\n",
    "The benefits from more expressive projections in TransR adds to the complexity of the model as well as higher rate of moving data around which has an adverse effect on distributed training. TransE requires $O(d)$ parameters per relation, where $d$ is the dimension of semantic space in TransE which includes both entities and relationships. As TransR projects entities to a relationship space of dimension $k$, it will require $O(kd)$ parameters per relation. depending on the size of k, this could potentially increase the number of parameters drastically. In exploring DGL-KE, we will examine benefits of DGL-KE in making computation of knowledge embedding significantly more efficient.\n",
