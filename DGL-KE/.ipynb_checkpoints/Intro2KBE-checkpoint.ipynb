    "Knowledge Graphs are often modeled as directed multigraphs. As a quick reminder let us define Multigrpah and directed graphs:\n",
    "- In a directed graph edges are called arcs and they can direct information from their head to their tail but not in the opposite direction.\n",
    "- A multigraph is a graph that can includes loops as well as multiple relationships between the same nodes.\n",

    "Knowledge graph embedding is the task of completing the knowledge graphs by probabilistically inferring the missing arcs from the existing graph structure. KGE differs from ordinary relation inference as the information in a knowledge graph are multi-relational and more complex to model and computationally expensive. For this rest of this blog, we examine fundamentals of KGE."

    "# Score Function\n",
    "There are different flavours of KGE that have been developed over the course of the past few years. What most of them have in common is a score function. The score function measures how distant two nodes in relations to a relation are. As we are setting the stage to introduce the reader to DGL-KE, an open source knowledge graph embedding library, we limit the scope only to those methods that are implemented by DGL-KE and are listed in figure 2. \n",

    "## A short explanation of the score functions\n",
    "Knowledge graphs that are beyond toy examples are always large, high dimensional, and sparse. High dimensionality and sparsity are the results of the amount of information that the KG holds that can be represented with 1-hot or n-hot vectors. The fact that most of the items have no relationship withe one another is another major contributor to sparsity of KG representations. We, therefore desire to project the sparse and high dimensional graph representational vector space onto a lower dimensional dense space. This process is similar to to word embedding and dimensionality reduction used for [recommender systems baesd on matrix factorization models.](https://www.slideshare.net/apachemxnet/building-content-recommendation-systems-using-mxnet-gluon)\n",
    "I will provide a detailed account of all the methods in a different post, but here I will provide a short explanation of how projections differ in each paper, what the score functions do, and what consequences the choices have on on relationship inference and computational complexity."

    "### TransE:\n",
    "TransE is a representative translational distance model that represents entities and relations as vectors in the same semantic space of dimension $\\mathbb{R^d}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the target space with reduced dimension. A fact in the source space is represented as a triplet $(h, r, t)$ where $h$ is short for *head*, $r$ is for *relation*, and $t$ is for *tail*. The relationship is interpreted as a translation vector so that the embedded entities are connected by relation $r$ have a short distance. [3, 4]\n",
    "In terms of vector computation it could mean adding a head to a relation should approximate to the relation's tail, or $h+r \\approx t$. For example if $h_1=emb(\"Ottawa\"),\\ h_2=emb(\"Berlin\"), t_1=emb(\"Canada\"), t_2=(\"Germany\"),\\ and\\ finally\\ r=\"CapilatOf\"$, then $h_1 + r$ and $h_2+r$ should approximate $t_1$ and $t_2$ respectively.\n",

    "TransE cannot cover relationship that are not 1-to-1 as it learns only one aspect of similarity. TransR addresses this issue with separating relationship space from entity space where $h, t \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ and $r \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. The semantic spaces do not need to be of the same dimension. In the multi-relationship modeling we learn a projection matrix $M\\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times d}$ for each relationship that can project an entity to different relationship semantic spaces. Each of these spaces capture a different aspect of an entity that is related to a distinct relationship. In this case a head node $h$ and a tail node $t$ in relation to relationship $r$ is projected into the relationship space using the learned projection matrix $M_r$ as $h_r=hM_r$ and $t_r=tM_r$ respectively.Figure 5 illustrates this projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us explore this using an example. Mary and Tom are siblings and colleagues. They both are vegetarians. Joe also works for Amazon and is a colleague of Mary and Tom. TransE might end up learning very similar embedding for Mary, Tom, and Joe from the fact that they are colleagues but fail to recognize the (not)sibling relationship.\n",
    "Using TransR, we learn projection matrices: $M_{sib},\\ M_{clg}\\ ,and M_{vgt}$ that perform better on learning relationship like (not)sibling. \n",
    "The score function in TransR is similar to TransE and measures euclidean distance between $h+r$ and $t$, but the distance measure is per relationship space. More formally: $f_r=\\|h_r+r-t_r\\|_2^2$\n",
